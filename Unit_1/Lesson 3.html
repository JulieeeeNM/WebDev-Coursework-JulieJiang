        <h1>What's my hobby</h1>
        <p>I’m someone who loves mixing creativity with tech—I watch YouTube tutorials to sharpen skills like photo editing, scour Reddit for gaming or gadget chats, and fall down Wikipedia rabbit holes when a random question pops up.  I compare prices on Amazon for hours (because why not?) and rely on Google to fact-check everything. </p>
